How to build the Rhodes app for Symbian
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview

    The Rhodes for Symbian consists of 4 projects: 
      - rhodes: the main project 
      - rubylib: ruby vm. Ruby interpretator project
      - shttpd: local http server
      - SQLite60, sqlite ported to S60

    3 of all projects are developed in C for Symbian. 
    Rhodes is C++ project.


2. Requirements

    To compile the source files, you need to install the following:
      1) "Nokia S60 3rd Edition SDK for Symbian OS, for C++, Feature Pack 1 or later" 
         Can be downloaded from http://www.forum.nokia.com, under 'Tools & SDKs' section for S60 platform.
         Note: from release notes "it is recommended to install the SDK to default location" (under C: drive).
      2) PIPS library - "pips_9_1_s60_sdk_1_2.zip".
         This Plugin is not included in official SDK, it's required by ruby vm.
         - Download the plugin zip file from http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/
         - Release notes: https://developer.symbian.com/wiki/download/attachments/1411/pips_readme_1_2.pdf
         - Locate and extract the files from the archive
         - Extract it and follow inner instructions to copy files into S60 SDK system directories.
      3) [OPTIONAL] A Symbian C++ developement environment, preferred: "Carbide C++ v1.3".
         Downloadable from: http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/tools_and_sdks/carbide_cpp/

    To build the SIS package, you need to download and install the following: 
      1) "Active Pearl v.5.6.1", required to build Symbian SDK scripts.
         Note: need this specific version because it's the one tested to work with S60 SDK, it is not guaranteed to 
               work with any other versions of Active Pearl. Downloadable from: http://www.activestate.com
      2) "Apache Ant" (http://ant.apache.org/) 
      4) A GIT Client, to download source code from GIT
      5) To sign the SIS package, you need a valid Symbian certificate + key. 
         Only singed packages (SISX) can be installed on real devices.
         - Go to www.symbiansigned.com 
         - Follow instructions to obtain a valid certificate/key to sign a Symbian application
         - Put your certificate (.cert) and key (.key) files under the folder "symbian/rhodes/sis/cert/"
         
         Also you are able to use self-signed generated keys 


3. Building the SIS package

    The output files are ".SISX" packages, created by the Apache 'ant' build tool.
    During the building process, all projects are compiled for GCCE platform (for devices) and UREL target (release).

      1) Go to the folder: 'symbian/build'
      2) Open the file 'build.properties' using a text editor:
         - redefine the path of "Nokia S60 3rd Edition SDK" ("S60_3rd_FP1" property) if necessary (if different)
         - redefine the Symbian certificate properties, used to sign the output SIS file.
         - redefine other stuff if required
      3) Open a command prompt 
      4) Go to the directory 'symbian/build'
      5) Type: "ant" to see supported targets

4. Supported tagets

      For developement only: build based on working dirs

      build-all          : to clean + build + make sis + sign sis (no checkout)
      build-selfsign     : to clean + build + make sis + selfsign sis (no checkout)
      build-build        : to build + make sis + sign sis (no clean, no checkout)
      build-sis          : to make sis + sign sis (no clean, no checkout, no build)

      In general you have 3 options:

      1) Build package based on working dirs (all targets started from 'build-' prefix)

      2) Build release package. In this case build script will checked out latest sources from GIT to build them from scratch. 
          It maybe usefull for build machine etc...

      3) Build RhoBundle

      You can see supported targets using "ant" command without parameters

      Note: You must provide SDK version using SDK parameter. For example: ant build-all -DSDK=S60_3rd_FP1

      Output files (and logs) will be placed in 'symbian/bin':
      - "rhodes_v-x.y.z.sis"    is the main package
      - "rhodes_v-x.y.z.sisx"    is the main signed package
